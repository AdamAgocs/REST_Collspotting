# Collaboration Spotting - RESTful API

[Collaboration Spotting](http://collspotting.web.cern.ch) is a platform designed to support visual analytics of multivariate knowledge graphs built out of data from heterogeneous sources. This repository contains the implementation of the project's API which combines REST architecture style, JSON Schema/JSON Meta Schema and Neo4j database (storing data). It is implemented in Python using Django Web framework.
